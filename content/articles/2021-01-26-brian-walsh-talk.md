As a newcomer to marketing, I imagine I'm not the only one who thought of customer experience as an ambiguous, hand-wavy, ill-defined aspect of marketing in general. Recently, I was in an online talk given by Brian Walsh, in which he highlighted the importance of customer experience by way of a stunningly effective anecdote, forever removing any doubt in my mind.

Brian Walsh is an engineer who has for the past ten years been a customer experience design specialist, at Oracle for seven years, founding and running his own consultancy [Structured Empathy](https://structuredempathy.com/) in 2018.

## Doug's story

Knowing how difficult it is to get the attention and buy-in of profit goal-oriented corporate leadership, and to convert them into active proponents of a seemingly conflicting paradigm, he introduces customer experience through the hard-hitting true story of Doug Dietz, principal designer at GE healthcare. Prior to his eye-opening experience, Doug had been designing diagnostic imaging equipment, MRI machines and CT scanners for General Electric. As the proud _father_ of a new MRI machine, he cheerfully visited a children's hospital to see it in action. To his horror, instead of witnessing a resounding success, what he saw was a terrified young girl, frightened of the clinical surroundings, the dreadful hospital smell, the scary warning signs, and the imposing, giant, claustrophobia-inducing and extremely noisy machine into which she was about to be fed.

Regardless of the preparation her parents had given her, she was afraid, refusing to subject herself to the scanner, leaving the nurses and technicians no choice but to anaesthetize her. So inured to this state were the technicians, they readily admitted that up to 80% of children had to be sedated in order to obtain a usable MRI or CT scan!

> Can we come back tomorrow?

Heartbroken at realizing that his creation was the cause of so much pain, and as a father himself, together with his team, he came up with a range of ingenious solutions making a visit to one of these diagnostic imagers smooth. By creating a range of fully themed and multi-sensory immersive experiences around the diagnostic rooms and machines within, they turned the entire experience around so thoroughly, not only getting children's acceptance, also gaining an element of _fun_. In one situation Doug had witnessed, after her imaging a young girl tugged at her mother's sleeve, asking "Can we come back tomorrow?"

Having started from a position of complete failure, from the perspective of his frightened customers, the children patients, Doug and his team secured a multitude of spectacular successes:

- Patient satisfaction has jumped up by 92%
- Sedation, which was at approximately 80% rates previously, had fallen to two children in one year
- Costs have fallen, both through increased bandwidth as more children can be imaged, and also through reduced support needs as sedation has dropped from being a common occurrence to an anomaly

Beyond the measurable financial benefits, there were tangible emotional benefits all round as well. Children are now less anxious, if at all, making the experience less tormenting to parents. And, by being enjoyable, Doug found that the children fed off the parents' happiness, who, in turn, fed off the joy experienced by their kids. The children and parents weren't the sole customers for Doug's product; the diagnostic room technicians count among the many hospital staff who are _customers_ to the product. So overjoyed was one technician during one of Doug's many post-implementation visits, that she confessed to him "This experience reminded me of why I got into healthcare." The trauma had been commonplace for so long that healthcare workers like her had grown numb to the suffering, forgetting their own desires of actually helping to heal their patients! They felt helpless, that they had no _agency_.

## Products begin with empathy

The learning Brian instilled in us is that in the commercial world, we often begin by designing a product or service without much thought of the customer. Often the design for the imagined solution begins by looking at existing services in the market, or by creating a technological marvel with little thought to its delivery. Ultimately, the customer figures last in many product-design pipelines, and that's wrong. By taking this route, it shouldn't come as any surprise that the customer is unhappy. What is really happening is that most---and often all---competitors offer an equally poor service (as evidenced by industry-wide NPS scores), and that is why the industry sees little change.

Brian's talk reminded us that the key to a good customer experience is _empathy_, and that it's customer experience that wins customers, not merely the product, price or promotion. He highlighted three types of empathy to practice: _visual empathy_, imagining what the customer sees; _cognitive empathy_, imagining what the customer is thinking; and _emotional empathy_, imagining what the customer feels.

On a practical level, Brian tells us not to map every customer journey, but to start by concentrating on the worst customer experiences. This is very _Agile_ thinking, in incrementally improving experiences from worst backwards, until the experience seems good, and then to appraise the experiences all over again as necessary. This provides a roadmap that is simple to implement.

Finally, I asked him how he would go about appraising and mapping the customer journey in a startup, where there is no past data to look at, where everything is new and relatively unknown? Again, Brian's advice was straightforward and enlightening: map out the most likely customers' needs as part of the minimum viable product (MVP), then map them out in a journey. However, he exhorts us to bring in all the founders, investors as well as potential customers, to define a journey that takes into account all stakeholders' needs. Look at the current state of the market and determine---without exaggerating---what needs aren't being met, imagining problems and curveballs along that journey. Use that planning to surface root causes, by putting ourselves in customer shoes, and through doing all that to gain customer trust and credibility, not through words and lofty promises. He left us with a commonly known but often ignored pearl of wisdom:

> Treat people the way you want to be treated.

And, in my startup journey, this is advice I will do well to heed.
