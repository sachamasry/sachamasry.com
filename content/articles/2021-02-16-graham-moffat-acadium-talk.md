As anyone who has rebranded---or learnt a new skill and branched off into a new career direction---knows, it can be impossible to break into a new industry. Why? Job postings and freelancer opportunities are torturously worded, painting a picture of a _unicorn_ for the ideal candidate: young, willing to learn and retrain, yet with years of applied industry experience. How can anyone get years of experience if no company is willing to hire them and help them earn it? How is it that as a society we preach the importance of life-long learning, retraining and career flexibility, yet offer scant opportunities to those who choose to follow that mantra?

In the mainstream we've forgotten a valued way to come by deep and practical experience, one used for centuries in trades and crafts, because it's so quaint and old-fashioned: apprenticeships. For long a master-apprentice relationship was the norm; in some demanding fields and in some countries it is still relied on as a time-honoured way of learning and mastering new skills. However, in many modern skills---particularly in the digital sphere---it isn't a concept that is often applied. In its place are expensive courses, as well as random and unvetted internship opportunities, both serving as formidable barriers to entry for many who wish to start work in a new industry. Fortunately, new startups have sprung up in every field, often relying on new methodologies, or new ways of applying existing methods, and I'm glad to say apprenticeships are amongst them.

## Apprenticeships are receiving recognition in digital crafts

I was fortunate to catch a talk by Graham Moffat, of [Acadium](https://acadium.com/), on exactly this burning topic. Acadium, a relatively new Canadian startup, founded in 2016, has set itself up to tackle this burning issue. Their mission, "making education free and accessible to anyone, anywhere", choosing to "to accelerate human potential" ([Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/acadium)), is a very important one, and one close to my heart. I've spent all my working life learning new skills, all of them valuable and important, but skills I've always struggled in using commercially owing to a lack of industry experience. Even as I write, I'm in the process of deeply learning _and_ applying a new skillset, marketing, so I appreciate this company's offerings on a much more personal level.

Acadium takes the current concept of a _marketplace_, much like that of Uber, AirBnB, Upwork and many others, adapting it to the challenge of kickstarting digital careers. The beauty is that it offers an effectively _free_ education to those wishing to learn and practice any of a range of new skills, while only demanding 10--15 hours of the apprentice's time every week. This leaves time for the budding apprentice to work elsewhere, and not have to struggle to _pay_ for this new education and experience, traditionally a problem with both specialized college courses and internships. The benefits don't only accrue to the candidate, though, businesses who provide a mentor also benefit in the form of work carried out by the apprentice. The best outcome is that the business will be so satisfied with the apprentice's work and ethic during their three-month exchange, that they decide to offer the candidate a permanent position at its close. Even if it doesn't work out so perfectly, the candidate will have gained real demonstrable experience to advertise on their resumé, as well as a reference from a company in the industry.

At this point it is important to remember that many digital skills have extremely democratic beginnings, and that mentoring is nothing new. From its very beginnings, programming and related activities sprang up from experimentation, more than as defined practices stemming from academia. Through much failing, best practices arose, and those who had obtained a level of experience always gave it away to those coming up in the field. In programming, mentorship for newcomers in most companies is the norm, encapsulating practices such as pair-programming. Similar progressions were visible in digital arts, from graphic design and typography to website development. In video, a complex field with many inherited rules---colour theory, composition, tonality, lighting, photography and more---as well as complex and unique mechanical issues specific to the field, mentoring has always been the norm, not the exception. Marketing was no exception, going back to times well before its current digital incarnation, most of the learning was practical---on the job---rather than what was ever taught in academically-laden university degrees. I know this from my own marketing learning at university. 

So if that's the case, it's fair to ask, _what_ then has Acadium brought to the field that's new and valuable?

## Enter the marketplace

As is so often the case with the current startup _marketplace_ craze, Acadium has done nothing revolutionary. As is so often the case, the company has taken a range of disparate existing practices, often used---as I pointed out---in different ways according to industry, and they've codified a new approach. While pair programming, mentoring by graphic designers, videographers, marketers, etc. has always existed, to the person wanting to enter that career that mentorship wasn't a possibility until they were given a job offer. Then, over a three to six month probationary period they would receive the mentorship from those with experience in the company. However, the candidate still had to go through a grueling period of job applications and interviews to get that opportuntity. Legal realities made it impractical for companies to offer a job to just any promising candidate, while the process was effectively very resource-intensive and expensive for the candidate. In reality, both sides lost out in this arrangement.

The other enshrined practice which has always existed is the internship. While a candidate could arguably get an internship at a desired company more easily, and have access to the same mentorship opportunities, it meant that they were limited by location---as they had to be within commuting distance from the company---and the process was very time intensive and financially expensive, as they had to work full-time for the organization, while still having to meet existing financial obligations, without the ability to get a second job to pay their way during the internship.


> Acadium started with the belief that anyone, anywhere, should be able to get the skills and experience they need to start their career without barriers like price, schedule, or location getting in their way.

And that is exactly what Acadium has set out to change forever. By setting themselves up as a global provider of apprenticeship opportunities---demonstrated by their seeking of private investment during a seed-level funding round in 2020 ([Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/acadium))---they are removing the barrier of location. The stated premise is that all apprenticeships will be fully remote, for the full three-month duration of the exchange.

Very importantly, the company highlights that the entire experience is free for the learner, removing a second very significant barrier to learning. And, by demanding only ten hours a week, plus time for the actual one-on-one mentorship and course work, a significant portion of the week is freed up to the candidate, to get other work to keep on top of their financial demands.

Finally, by receiving onboarding, mentoring, practical work experience, a certificate and a reference from the company, the apprentice opens the way to many new career paths.

Pragmatically, both parties profit from this relationship. Companies who offer their mentors to the program benefit in a number of ways, too. Apart from fostering new and budding talent, a business is provided with a way of growing their staff much more affordably, and with fewer legal hurdles than by offering a job and testing the candidate and the profitability of the position during an initial probation period, taking the risk out of hiring with this approach. 

Further risk is taken out of the process by Acadium, who themselves vet candidates before accepting them to the marketplace. Importantly, the same benefit works to the candidate's advantage too.

> Acadium gives you tools, support, and mentorship you need to launch your dream career.

I must admit to being wary of the process of internships for a number of reasons, from both perspectives. Some of my biases are real, others imagined, but all need to be challenged. Hearing Graham lay out Acadium's mission has made me reappraise my apprehensions honestly. As I build up a fledgling startup, I intend to face my objections head-on, and take on apprentices as needed, through Acadium, for all the benefits that this will offer the company. 

No less importantly, for me personally, is the opportunity to finally give back to the community in the same measure as I have received in my career to date, through mentoring those just starting out. I've been in the position of mentoring people who weren't ready or equipped for a new career, and the investment has gone wasted. The Acadium model of pre-vetting candidates should work to remove this important limitation, filtering out weak candidates, letting through the very best, the hungriest and most capable potential apprentices.
