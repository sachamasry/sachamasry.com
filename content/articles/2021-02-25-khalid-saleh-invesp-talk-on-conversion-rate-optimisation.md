I'm late to the party, but the reification of the concept of conversion rate optimization (CRO) into a field of study was completely unknown to me until I heard a talk by [Khalid Saleh](https://www.invespcro.com/blog/khalid-saleh/), co-founder and CEO of [Invesp](https://www.invespcro.com/), which completely opened my eyes. So, what is it that makes CRO so important?

I must admit that I had never heard of Khalid in all my time in web design and development, but he is somewhat of a giant in the digital marketing space, co-founding Invesp in 2006 with Ayat Shukairy, before the term _Conversion Rate Optimization_ had even been coined. They developed a process in 2007, the _Conversion Framework_ ™, built on eight principles and designed to remove the guesswork from the conversion optimization process, to help increase conversion rates.

They went on to write a book in the field, published in 2011 by O'Reilly, [Conversion Optimization: The Art and Science of Converting Prospects to Customers](https://www.amazon.com/Conversion-Optimization-Converting-Prospects-Customers/dp/1449377564/ref=sr_1_1_bnp_1_pap?ie=UTF8&qid=1370285129&sr=8-1&keywords=conversion+optimization), brutally prefacing it with: "Ten orders was all we had to show our client for their $15 million investment. It was a disaster." (Saleh and Shukairy, 2011), "…As a matter of a fact, the website generated less than 100 orders in the first 30 days. Yes, 100 orders for a 50 million-dollar investment." This soul-searchingly honest observation, more than anything I can say here, paints the painful picture of why every web designer, ad agency, marketer and business owner has to sit up and take notice---what we think of as intuitively _better_ is often proved to have a worse conversion rate. The lesson in all of this is to relentlessly and consistently run tests on every aspect of our digital presence, or do nothing and consistently lose money without ever realising why.

Even though I'm making myself look like an instant believer, I'm not. In the distant past, I spent time researching split-testing and multi-armed bandit algorithms, reading [Bandit Algorithms for Website Optimization, White, J. M., O'Reilly (2013)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/bandit-algorithms-for/9781449341565/), but I have done nothing with this newfound knowledge. I can unashamedly attest to having made all the same mistakes---over the years---which Khalid describes, even of thinking that a better design _must logically_ convert better than a different, more functional one. In his talk, Khalid candidly presented us some tests which their company carried out on behalf of clients, showing us the control page, as well as the hypothesized variant(s), along with their eventually measured conversion rates. Some of those tests clearly demonstrate that even variations he himself thought would improve conversion actually worsened the conversion rate. This was the clearest demonstration yet of the power of testing and the fallacy of hanging on to a clearly biased or simply poorly informed intuition.

A quick search on the internet quickly surfaced the level of respect for the book. _Conversion Optimization_ is simply referred to tirelessly by multiple trusted sources in marketing, conversion optimization, management, and even the startup sphere as a must-read, one of the most important books in marketing. I urge anyone who is still sitting on the fence---as I was---to peruse these thoughtful reviews.

It was two final things Khalid told us that got my attention; owing to a problem he had with a Turkish website---a language Khalid doesn't speak---he reminded us of the unstated truth that a well-designed website should be usable even in a foreign language. This is a deep truth following on from established good user interface design and usability patterns, that one should be able to use a software application without having to read the manual! From 15 years' data in CRO, it is estimated that A/B testing has yielded a 12-15% industry average success rate. While this may not seem significant overall, Invesp case studies claim far greater improvements, anywhere from 16--60%, and up to four-fold increases in ROI for some of its customers.

As for me, I'm now a convert and have already bought my own copy and am engrossed in the book, hungrily devouring it. Khalid's visceral demonstration is making me itch and look forward to applying it to existing web projects, much in need of jump-starting, of increased awareness and improved conversion.

Researching the field since the talk, I have also discovered that Invesp Academy has an online course, [Conversion Optimization Mastery: A step-by-step process to becoming a conversion rate optimization master](https://academy.invespcro.com/courses/conversion-optimization-mastery) dedicated to teaching their eight principle methodology. It's inexpensive considering the vast amounts of money we bleed due to not optimizing conversion, and I'm certainly going to take the course, applying one more important and practical tool to my marketing efforts.

I'm finally ready to heed Khalid's succinct call to action: _Test everything_!
