In my marketing degree, and from a select group of excellent speakers, I have learned lessons of great impact. 

Customer experience is far more important than I ever credited it with. A carefully thought-out and well-crafted experience may make the product a success, but a badly designed or implemented experience will destroy it. While this statement sounds tautological, the subtlety it hides from plain sight is that a perfectly functional, even good, design may fail its intended users in innumerable ways. 

This realization leads to the conclusion that a company needs to choose which customer segment is of greater strategic importance, and actively try to satisfy that segment. Secondary segments, if any are still pursued, may have to do with a satisficing approach, or carefully-designed customer experiences to suit them, too.

Gaining experience and staffing suffer a symmetrical problem: individuals need to get highly specific experience in new fields to be able to compete for jobs, while companies, particularly startups, need to staff the ranks quickly, cheaply and need workers able and willing to learn. 

Apprenticeships are one good solution to both sides of this coin. Through them, those who are retraining and changing careers can gain actual, marketable experience needed for gainful employment. Small companies need staff who are willing to learn, not only specific skills, but more so their own custom workflows and ways of working, methodologies which may confer these companies with competitive advantage. Through offering apprenticeships to potential, but unproven, candidates, companies bear the cost of teaching a targeted field of knowledge in which they need staff, with the advantages that:

1. They don't bear any financial risk through regulatory employment laws
1. They train the candidates in their own workflow, and have the ability to measure their output and fit within the company culture
1. Gain the ability to quickly staff a range of positions ate relatively low expense

Creating beautifully-designed pages, emails, social posts isn't sufficient. There is always a conversion goal, and once critical conversion paths are identified, the funnels leading up to them have to be relentlessly optimized. This is the field of Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO), and is one of the most important activities in the design and implementation of sales and marketing funnels.

The logical conclusion is that all important revenue and engagement paths must be heavily scrutinized and weaknesses spotted. Then, hypotheses need to be made as to all potential causes of the weaknesses, along with ideas which may improve results. Finally, rigorous, controlled tests must be carried out on all the hypotheses, with the results recorded and filtered for statistical significance. Ideally, significant improvements should be adopted, followed by incrementally testing every hypothesis for all the weaknesses, ad infinitum.

Data shows that the most successful companies carry out hundreds to thousands of tests every year, in a relentless effort to squeeze out every remaining efficiency from their processes.

These, and more, are lessons seared into my mind by a series of speakers. Learning from them has opened my eyes to new problems and novel ways of analysis; they were my giants in the process of learning about marketing, who themselves stand on the shoulders of other giants, etc. forming a tower of Babel, of knowledge. 

During my time at academia, through networking I have also met a range of successful and valuable contacts. One is a startup founder providing the diametrically opposite service to apprenticeships, vetting highly skilled freelancers---specifically in development and technology---through interviews and testing, prior to adding them to a select pool of very highly-skilled, and well-remunerated, candidates for a range of technology roles at vetted and reviewed companies. Another runs a North American chapter of a pragmatic and totally non-academic small to medium-sized business marketing course. Yet another is the founder of an influential technology meet-up in Toronto. Others include the founder of a wellness group in Toronto, seed investors in startups, as well as several startup founders, not to mention a range of acutely sharp professors---each with their consulting businesses---at George Brown College.

I recognize how much I've learned through talking with these individuals, and how much there is I don't know. These lessons I would not have learned had I not engaged in networking. As I approach the end of my academic term, I recognize the importance of deepening relationships with these mentors. Naturally, these are very busy people, to the last, and in all cases I will offer my time and a way in which I may be able to help them, in order to build fruitful and long partnerships.

The past two years have been but a start in marketing for me, and I will cement and deepen that knowledge by continuing my learning practically, by speaking to people in the industry who can help open my eyes to further discoveries, especially in a field as rich and progressive as this one is. Networking is the secret weapon that will unlock all opportunities for me in marketing, and I intend to pursue it actively.
