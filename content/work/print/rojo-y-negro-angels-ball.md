## Dance event flyer

Advertising a one-off event in a stylish classical London ballroom, decorated
with statues of angels on columns. Logo is inspired by angels' wings, its
swirls mimicking intricate decorations on the walls.

Cursive wordmark attempts builds on the theme, while the thin copy typeface
brings the feel more into tango's 20th century.
