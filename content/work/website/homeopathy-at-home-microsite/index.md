## Homeopathy at Home online course microsite

Microsite for an online course microsite, serving as the top of the marketing
funnel, completed by a full learning management system with course materials.

Developed full branding, colour palette and style guide for this product,
applying it to the learning area, printed course handouts, presentation slides
and both marketing and learning video content.

The logo is made up of four elements, laid out in independent concentric rings.
As this single-page marketing site is scrolled, the logo is always fixed to the
centre of the screen, and each component concentric circle rotates directly in
response to the scrolling action. For a more dynamic effect, each _ring_ rotates
in the opposite direction to the one next to it, creating—along with the
transparency effect throughout the components on the page—a very unique,
pleasing and dynamic effect (see video below).
