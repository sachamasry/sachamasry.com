## Patient appointments dashboard

A patient-facing practitioner needed insight into one of their revenue streams:
patient appointments. They need to know how much revenue appointments generate,
highlighting any mitigable issues leading to missed appointments, and
identifying patients likely to need a follow-up appointment. A desirable goal
was to surface any actionable insights, which would reduce the cost of marketing
by improving use of available patient data.

Having connected to their platform's data, manipulating it into an easily
analysable dataset, I proceeded to design a sales and marketing _dashboard_,
showing them the state of the appointments side of the business in real-time.

I split the dashboard into five sections, providing different levels of data:

- general metrics
- sales revenue
- RFM overview
- strategic marketing: patient segmentation
- potential data problems

The insights provided by the dashboard made it quick to reduce simple errors,
ensuring there would be no further missed appointments due to user error.

With the dashboard available and presenting live analysis, it was now easy to
see progress, set goals and reach patients who had simply forgotten to make
contact to book follow-up appointments, leading to providing a better service
and improved patient satisfaction. Through segmentation of their patient base,
they could now reach patients in a highly targeted way to bolster their revenue
with minimal marketing expense.


### General metrics

The most visible section of the dashboard provides at-a-glance, aggregated
metrics, providing insight into the company's performance.

### Sales revenue

{{<figure src="/img/web-applications/patient_dashboard-graphs.jpg" title="Monthly appointment revenues">}}

It is important to be able to follow monthly revenue in order to be able to set
marketing and patient outreach goals, using this feedback to direct further
efforts. This section presents to-date monthly revenue, presenting historical
values for direct comparison.

### RFM Metrics

{{<figure src="/img/web-applications/patient_dashboard-rfm_analytics.jpg" title="RFM metrics">}}

RFM is a methodology by which patients are segmented according to three criteria: the
recency of their last appointment, the frequency of their appointments, and their
revenue to date. This section presents a coarse overview of the overall
patient figures.

Designing a marketing outreach by combining these three coarse patient metrics
is most likely to result in follow-up appointments, and is made available to
enable precision marketing.

### Patient segmentation

Patients have been segmented across two variables: recency of their last
appointment and by their lifetime value to the company, to date. Combined with dedicated
reporting of patients whose most recent appointment was over sixty days ago, as
well as those who have only had one appointment, administrators now have the
ability to concentrate their efforts on those patients who are most likely to
need a professional follow-up.

### Warning of potential data problems

Finally, there is a separate dashboard listing the most likely data problems
that may occur through operator error. This includes an analysis of common
data-entry issues which can skew aggregate data or lead to missed appointments
and lost revenue.
