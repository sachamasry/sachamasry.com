## Health product manufacturer marketing dashboard

This manufacturer of natural health-related products wanted to increase their
revenue, number of clients and geographic reach. While they sell predominantly
online through a prominent ecommerce platform collecting much valuable
information, the stakeholders had little insight into the state of their
business.

Having connected to their platform's data, manipulating it into an easily
anaysable dataset, I proceeded to design for them a sales and marketing
_dashboard_, showing them their state at any time. This dashboard was split into
five sections, providing different levels of data:

- general metrics
- sales revenue
- RFM overview
- geographic reach
- strategic marketing: customer segmentation

The end result was that this dashboard gave the company a way to measure their
progress, to set goals and determine whether and how well they were being met.
Crucially, through segmentation of their customer base, they could now market
special offers more selectively, better customising the message to the target
segment and later monitoring the effect of these marketing efforts.

### General metrics

The most visible section of the dashboard provides at-a-glance, aggregated
metrics to be used on a regular basis as a view into the company's performance.
There are some valuable metrics here to keep an eye on, such as the average number of
days between purchases, customer value, average number of items per order, mean
monthly revenue, etc.

There is coarse customer segmentation by order size as well as location. Top
products by sales value and a shopping cart breakdown by number of items are all
presented here.

### Sales revenue

It is important to be able to follow monthly revenue on a daily basis, in order
to be able to affect sales through promotions, giveaways and discounts, among
other devices. This section presents to-date monthly revenue, presenting
historical values for direct comparison.

### RFM Metrics

RFM is a methodology which attempts to segment customers by three criteria: the
recency of their order, the frequency with which they buy, and the value of
their orders. This section presents a coarse overview of the overall customer
figures.

### Customer segmentation

Finally, customers are segmented across two axes: number of orders, and order
value. This provides the business a strategic view of their higher-spending
customers, making it possible to target one or more segment with personalised
offers for higher sales.
