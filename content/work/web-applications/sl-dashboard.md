## Health product manufacturer marketing dashboard

A manufacturer of natural health-related products set a direction to increase
their revenue, number of clients, and expand their geographic reach. While they
sell their products mainly online, through a prominent ecommerce platform
collecting much valuable information, at the start the stakeholders had little
insight into the actual state of the business. Also, they had few immediately
actionable insights they could act upon, beyond intuitive reasoning.

Having connected to their platform's data, manipulating it into an easily
analysable dataset, I proceeded to design a sales and marketing _dashboard_,
showing them the state of the business at any time. 

I split the dashboard into five sections, providing different levels of data:

- general metrics
- sales revenue
- RFM overview
- geographic reach
- strategic marketing: customer segmentation


In the end, this dashboard gave the company a way to easily see progress, to set
goals and determine whether and how well they were meeting them on a monthly
basis. Crucially, through segmentation of their customer base, they could now
market special offers more selectively to the existing customer base, better
customising the message to the target segment while monitoring the effects
of these marketing efforts.


### General metrics

The most visible section of the dashboard provides at-a-glance, aggregated
metrics to be used on a regular basis as a view into the company's performance.
There are some valuable metrics here to keep an eye on, such as the average number of
days between purchases, customer value, average number of items per order, mean
monthly revenue, etc.

There is coarse customer segmentation by order size as well as location. Top
products by sales value and a shopping cart breakdown by number of items are all
presented here.

### Sales revenue

It is important to be able to follow monthly revenue on a daily basis, in order
to be able to affect sales through promotions, giveaways and discounts, among
other devices. This section presents to-date monthly revenue, presenting
historical values for direct comparison.

### RFM Metrics

RFM is a methodology which attempts to segment customers by three criteria: the
recency of their order, the frequency with which they buy, and the value of
their orders. This section presents a coarse overview of the overall customer
figures.

### Customer segmentation

Finally, customers are segmented across two axes: number of orders, and order
value. This provides the business a strategic view of their higher-spending
customers, making it possible to target one or more segment with personalised
offers for higher sales.
