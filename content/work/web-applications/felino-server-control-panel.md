## Felino server control panel

Design and development of a simple, modular web application to manage physical
web servers.

Before virtual private servers (VPS) or cloud software deployments were common,
clients used physical server hardware to securely host their web applications,
internal knowledgebase and documentation systems to employees and stakeholders.
Non-specialised server hardware needed a few management features, preventing the
unsafe restart, shutdown—as well as other management actions—which would result
in data loss.

In this example, a modular control panel presents a simple web-based interface
to safely restart and power off the client's server, as well as a link to one of
their internal web applications, a document management system. Owing to their
need to keep their application and data confidential, the application is run
only on an internal network and is completely inaccessible from the internet.
