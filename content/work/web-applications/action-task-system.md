## Specialised task management system

Full application and user interface design, front and back-end development for a
task management system.

It is almost every developer who designs a task-management system, usually to
handle very modest task management needs as a web application. This system
interfaces with an existing web application-based project management system
through an API, but is designed with a different need in mind: rapid and simple
use on a command line terminal. While task information may be viewed and managed
graphically, the aim is of effortless ease in interfacing with the system
through the simplicity of the command-line, by entering text commands. This is
often faster, offering a busy developer or systems administrator a simple
interface with a minimal interruption to their focus.

Beyond the command-line interface, the system's second interface is one of the
oldest: pen and paper! For roles where computer use may be cumbersome—either due
to confidentiality requirements or simply the lack of space for a laptop, or
network connectivity—having a printout of that day's tasks and notes
presents the most learned and simple interface. Only that day's tasks are
printed, along with all notes kept regarding the task, prioritisation, estimated
time requirement and due date. It is easy to tick off the _completed_ box, and
also to add further tasks or notes by hand, to be entered into the system at the
end of the day.

The daily task and notes pages are beautifully typographically laid out, with a
careful choice of typefaces typeset in a way that maximises information
presentation on the page, while making important elements stand out clearly.
