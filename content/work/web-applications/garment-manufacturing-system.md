## Design of a full garment manufacturing system

Full user interface and UX design, front- and back-end development of a manufacturing system,
database and data migration from the legacy systems.

Prior to the development of the system, the client used a very large and hugely
complex spreadsheet to track every stage of their garment manufacture. This was
a laborious task, where each stage of the pipeline—where full manufacture could
take three or more months per garment style—was tracked with difficulty across
more than fifty columns of stages and checklists.

This process was error-prone, corruptible, and did not provide immediate answers
about what stage of manufacture a garment style was at, without some deciphering
by the person responsible for factory liaison. Worse, it was not integrated with
the company's accounting systems, making it extremely time-consuming and
laborious to calculate the company's inventory valuation, and with it cash flow
and foreign currency use requirements.

The manufacturing system became the solution, providing a centralised and very
robust database recording all the facts, leaving no room for data corruption,
connecting all the departments into one system to share information. With this
deeper integration between processes, it was possible to get inventory
valuations quickly and accurately, to quickly get a feel for how much foreign
currency was needed, and to better understand the company's cash flow situation.
Other departments, from initial garment design and prototyping to customer sales
were now also fully integrated into the same system, which was not the case
before when these departments functioned as separate silos within the company.
