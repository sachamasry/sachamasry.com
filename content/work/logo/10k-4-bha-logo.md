## Logo for fundraiser

Dedicated logo development for fundraising event. The 10k 4 BHA was a
fundraising month, asking for people to fundraise by pledging to do 10,000 units
of an activity of their choice, every day for an entire month: 10 kilometres,
10,000 steps, etc.

This flexibility is reinforced by the modern and active logo, showing cycling,
running and swimming as example activities one could engage in, inside a modern
and dynamic use of forward-leaning vertical bars spelling out the charity's
initials: BHA.
