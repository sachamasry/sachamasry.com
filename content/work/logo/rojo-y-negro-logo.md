## Rojo y Negro Argentine tango school logo (2006–2019)


Logo development for Argentine Tango school. Starting from a scan of the owner's
initial painted version of the company logo, is a simplified vectorisation—a
flattened logo (2006)—followed by a faux-3D treatment of it (2007).

Over the years the logo was updated and changed a few times.

Finally, the Art Deco treatment was adopted in its modernisation in 2013, which
was subsequently 3D-modeled and rendered, giving rise to two animation videos
used as branding in videos on social media. 

One is a camera ‘flyby’ of the logo's architectural details (see above); the second
one converts the logo's elements into a firework-like sparkling Christmas theme.
