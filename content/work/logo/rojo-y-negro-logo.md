## Rojo y Negro Argentine tango school logo (2006–2019)


Logo development for Argentine Tango school. Starting from a scan of the owner's
initial painted version of the company logo, is a simplified vectorisation—a
flattened logo (2006)—followed by a faux 3d treatment of it (2007). Over the
years the logo was updated and changed a few times. 

Finally, the Art Deco treatment was adopted in its modernisation in 2013, which
was subsequently 3d modeled and rendered, giving rise to two animation videos.
The left one is a camera ‘flyby’ of the logo's architectural details; the second
one converts the logo's elements into a firework-like sparkling Christmas theme.
