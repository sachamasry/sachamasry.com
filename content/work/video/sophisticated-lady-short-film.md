# Sophisticated Lady-short film

Video production, lighting, co-editing and colouring.

## Overview

The client wanted to produce a short video, capturing the very particular Film
Noir style, with a look to match the style's defining era (1940s), including
costume, set, props, lighting, soundtrack and video.

## Premise

This silent film captures one evening of our protagonist femme fatale, an
evening during which she apparently awaits a man, who never comes. We see her
ready to go out for the evening, dressed impeccably, until the dreaded call
comes, presumably telling her that he will be late. We see her waiting, trying
to pass the time, trying on accessories, pacing impatiently, drinking, smoking,
listening to music, checking her image and posing, all punctuated by her looking
out of the window for the expected arrival, which never comes. In the end, she
leaves by herself, and we witness her disappear into the foggy night.

The video's story presents the anguish of being stood up, and is told in a
metaphorical dreamlike sequence, with soft videography and a series of
disjointed, house-of-mirrors-like shots, expressing our protagonist's excitement
and expectation, followed by her inner anguish and final disappointment.

## Approach

I used a series of lights aimed at creating very directed and focused, hard
light, providing a highlight to desired features and details, the dress,
glinting jewellery, slits of light across the eyes, with shadow on the rest of
the face. The film revolves around the theme of reflections, disjointed sets and
oblique angles, presenting her memories and anguish at being made to wait. Thus,
we see reflection in many mirrors and windows in the story, and also shadows,
smoke and fog, producing a bit of a _smoke and mirrors_ effect.

{{<figure src="/img/videos/Sophisticated_lady-blowing_smoke.jpg" title="Smoking, the downfall of the sophisticated lady">}}

The whole film is shot in very soft focus, using a very narrow depth of field
making the film somewhat dream-like, so we never actually know whether what is
happening is real or if it is all her imagination or fantasy.

The soundtrack triggers unease and a further reinforcement that disappointment
is a necessary companion to beauty, style and sophistication.

## Outcome

This project demonstrates my videography, lighting and editorial (together with
the client) skills in creating artistic, expressionist video. Tight framing and
targeted lighting bring the story to a different level, removing our
protagonist's actual location from the viewer's mind, concentrating it on
emotion, elevating the expression of inner turmoil.

Colouring reduces much visual clutter, concentrating the viewer's eye on a much
narrowed visual field. While the video is black and white, it is coloured in
such a way to highlight—in black and white—the prevailing colours of the
actress' dress, shoes and accessories. The colour is also heavily crushed,
making the video appear much harsher than merely a palette of greys in the
frame.

{{<figure src="/img/videos/Sophisticated_lady-leaving_into_the_night.jpg" title=" Leaving, alone, into the night">}}

Finally, the video contains much post-production in hiding or de-emphasising
many elements in-frame, and adding a pleasing level of visual noise to make the
video less contemporary and digital, additionally making it appear part of the
desired era.
